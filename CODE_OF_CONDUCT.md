# Code of Conduct

It is crucial that we maintain a professional and respectful environment to ensure the success of our project. This code of conduct outlines the expectations and guidelines for behavior within our team:

### Communication
- Be open, honest, and respectful while communicating with team members.
- Allow everyone the opportunity to contribute their ideas, concerns, and feedback.
- Respond to emails and messages by other team members in due time.

### Collaboration
- Work as a team, supporting each other's efforts, and ensure equal participation from all members.
- Hold oneself and others accountable for our tasks and responsibilities.
- Maintain a flexible work ethic, willing to incorporate circumstances of each team member.

### Following Guidelines
- Adhere to guidelines listed here and elsewhere regarding the project.
- Comply with all University guidelines and policies.

### Scrum guidelines
**1. Sprint Planning:** At the start of each week, the team will hold a meeting to decide on tasks to work on for that week. Story points will be used to estimate the effort for each task. A new Scrum master will also be assigned every two weeks.

**2. Sprint Review:** At the end of the week, the team will gather to assess completed work, receive feedback, and discuss any adjustments needed for future sprints.

**3. Responsibilities:** 
- Scrum Master
    - Facilitate the scrum process.
    - Check in with team members regularly to monitor progress and address issues.
    - Ensure that the team adheres to the agreed-upon processes and schedules.

- Project Owner
    - Maintain the Project Backlog, ensuring tasks are clearly defined and prioritized.
    - Provide clarity and vision for the project, ensuring the team understands the goals.
    - Review completed tasks against objectives, accepting or requesting revisions as needed.

**4. Daily Standup:** The Scrum Master will communicate with each team member on the team's Discord server, focusing on progress, challenges, and support needed. This approach is flexible and considers the varying schedules of students.


### Dealing with Non-Compliance
- If a team member misses a meeting or lab session, they will be provided with a summary of the work done. However, repeated absence from meetings and lab sessions without communication will be escalated to the module tutor for intervention.
- Consistently failing to complete tasks assigned and hindering efforts to make adjustments causing delays and other problems to the team will be addressed collectively, and appropriate action will be taken.

By adhering to this code of conduct, we commit to fostering a positive and productive team environment, where all members feel valued, respected, and supported in their contributions to the project.
